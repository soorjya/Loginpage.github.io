A cool login page !!

This repo contains a login page that I built. The page is simple and straightforward, and it is designed to be easy to use and secure.

The login page is designed to be easy to use and secure. The username and password fields are required, and the password field is masked to protect your password from prying eyes. The remember me checkbox allows you to stay signed in to your account for a longer period of time. The create an account link allows you to create a new account if you don't have one already.
